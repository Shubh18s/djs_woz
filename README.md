# Spoken Dialog WOZ (djs_woz): A tool to perform Wizard of Oz experiments in speech-only Question Answering scenarios

Spoken Dialog WOZ is a web app that can be integrated with a smart speaker such as Google Nest Mini to conduct Wizard of Oz experiments in a speech-only scenario. The user (participant) interacts with the system using the smart speaker unaware about the existence of a human(wizard) controlling the system either partially or completely to respond to user's queries. The experimenter provides the strategies/scripts for a successful dialogue between the user and the system. The wizard follows these scripts to answer user's queries effectively with minimal congnitive load.
